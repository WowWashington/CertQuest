#
# 🚨 FILE LOCATION: This file MUST be placed in scenarios/ subdirectory
#
#    CORRECT: certifications/your-cert/scenarios/domain_1.yaml  ✅
#    WRONG:   certifications/your-cert/domain_1.yaml            ❌

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, etc.):
# 1. This file MUST be saved as: scenarios/domain_1.yaml (in scenarios/ subfolder)
# 2. Copy this ENTIRE file structure - do NOT invent your own format
# 3. Replace all [PLACEHOLDER] values with actual content
# 4. Keep the structure: domain, domain_name, scenarios (list of scenario objects)
# 5. Each scenario MUST have: id, domain, correct_index, themes
# 6. correct_index is 0-based (0=first choice, 1=second, 2=third, 3=fourth)
# 7. Create separate files for each domain: domain_1.yaml, domain_2.yaml, etc.
# 8. Do NOT use custom filenames like questions.yaml or quiz.yaml
#
# INSTRUCTIONS FOR HUMANS:
# 1. This file must be in the scenarios/ subfolder (not the root certification folder)
# 2. Edit this file to add your questions
# 3. Each scenario needs themed content for EVERY theme in config.yaml
# 4. If you have theme "standard" in config.yaml, each scenario needs themes.standard

          You are presented with a fundamental question about the topic.

          This narrative sets up the scenario and provides context for the
          question that follows. It should be engaging and relevant to the
          certification material.

          What is the correct approach?

          Excellent! You selected the correct answer.

          This is the right approach because [explanation of why this is correct].

          Key learning point: [reinforce the certification concept]

            That's not quite right.

            This answer is incorrect because [explanation].

            The correct approach is to [brief explanation of correct answer].
          2: |
            Incorrect. This is a common misconception.

            While it might seem reasonable, [explain why it's wrong].

            Remember: [key learning point]

  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # ADD MORE SCENARIOS BELOW
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Copy the scenario structure above and modify for each question.
  # Aim for scenarios_per_domain questions (as set in config.yaml).
  #
  # Tips:
  # - Make each id unique across all domains
  # - Vary correct_index (0, 1, 2, 3) so correct answer isn't always first
  # - Write clear explanations in failure_texts to help learning
  # - If you have multiple themes, add content for each theme key
