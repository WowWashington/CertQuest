      title: THE BUS FACTOR
      narrative: "\nMarcus, your senior DBA, just gave two weeks notice. He's taking a job\nat a competitor\
        \ for a 40% raise. Everyone wishes him well.\n\nThen reality sets in.\n\nMarcus is the only person\
        \ who knows the production database passwords.\nMarcus is the only one with access to the legacy\
        \ encryption keys. Marcus\nbuilt the backup system and never documented it. Marcus is the \"bus\
        \ factor\"\nfor basically your entire data infrastructure.\n\n\"I always meant to document everything,\"\
        \ he says apologetically. \"But\nthere was always something more urgent.\"\n\nIT leadership is\
        \ panicking. The CTO is asking how this happened.\n\nWhat do you recommend?\n                "
