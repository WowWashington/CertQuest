        0: "\n\"Business value depends on quick integration\" is how you end up with:\n- Corrupted customer\
          \ records nobody notices for months\n- PII in unprotected columns because classification wasn't\
          \ mapped\n- Former employees from the acquired company with admin access\n- Customer data still\
          \ sitting on servers you sold to a recycler\n\nRushed migrations create problems that take far\
          \ longer to fix than a\nproper migration would have taken. The business pressure doesn't eliminate\n\
          the security requirements - it just makes you pay for them later.\n                    "
        2: "\n\"Let IT handle it\" is how security gets relegated to cleanup duty.\n\nData migration has\
          \ massive security implications:\n- What data classifications apply to the migrated data?\n\
          - Who should have access in the new environment?\n- What happens to the source systems after\
          \ migration?\n- How do you verify nothing was lost or corrupted?\n\nIT can handle the technical\
          \ migration. Security needs to be involved in\nplanning, verification, and sanitization. This\
          \ isn't a technical matter -\nit's a custody transfer of potentially sensitive data.\n     \

        3: "\n\"Keep copies as backup\" sounds prudent but creates ongoing liability.\n\nThose old systems\
          \ will receive:\n- Less attention (everyone's focused on the new environment)\n- Fewer patches\
          \ (why maintain infrastructure you're decommissioning?)\n- Less monitoring (it's \"backup,\"\
          \ not production)\n\nMeanwhile, they still contain customer PII, employee records, and\nproprietary\
          \ data. You've just created an unprotected data store that\nwill sit there accumulating risk.\n\
          \nThe proper approach: verify migration completeness, THEN sanitize source\nsystems. Don't leave\
          \ data in limbo.\n                    "
