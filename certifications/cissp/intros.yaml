  narrator: THE KEEPER OF GOVERNANCE
  introduction: "\nThe Hall of Security and Risk Management is the foundation upon which all\nother domains\
    \ rest. Here, the ancient principles of governance, risk, and\ncompliance converge. You will learn\
    \ to see security not as a technical\npuzzle alone, but as a balance between protecting assets and\
    \ enabling the\nrealm to function.\n\nThis domain teaches you to think like a leader: How do we decide\
    \ what to\nprotect? How much risk is acceptable? What policies guide our guardians?\nYou will encounter\
    \ questions of ethics, business continuity, and the laws\nthat bind us all. Master these principles,\
    \ and you will have the foundation\nto understand every domain that follows.\n\nAbove all else, remember\
    \ the cardinal rule that governs every decision in\nthis Citadel: LIFE SAFETY IS ALWAYS THE HIGHEST\
    \ PRIORITY. No asset, no data,\nno secret is worth more than a human life. This principle will guide\
    \ you\nthrough every trial ahead, and it is the first lesson every guardian must\nlearn.\n        "

      \ out what we're protecting, why we're protecting it, and how much\nmoney we can convince the CFO\

      assessments (how bad could this really get?), business continuity (what\nhappens when the data center\
      \ floods?), and compliance (keeping auditors\nhappy so they'll leave us alone).\n\nHere's the one\
      \ rule that overrides everything else: LIFE SAFETY FIRST.\nIf the server room is on fire and someone's\
      \ trapped inside, you save the\nperson, not the backup tapes. No data is worth a human life. Ever.\

  narrator: THE GUARDIAN OF TREASURES
  introduction: "\nThe Vault of Asset Security holds the second great truth of our profession:\nyou cannot\
    \ protect what you do not know. Before any defense can be mounted,\nwe must first understand what\
    \ we guard - its value, its nature, and who\nbears responsibility for its safety.\n\nIn this domain,\
    \ you will learn the arts of classification and ownership.\nNot all treasures are equal; some require\
    \ iron vaults while others need\nonly wooden chests. You must distinguish between the DATA OWNER -\
    \ who\ndetermines how information should be protected - and the DATA CUSTODIAN -\nwho maintains it\
    \ day-to-day. These roles are distinct and essential.\n\nYou will discover how assets flow through\
    \ their lifecycle: from creation\nthrough storage, use, and sharing, to eventual archival or destruction.\n\
    Pay special attention to the concept of DATA REMANENCE - the ghost of\ninformation that lingers even\
    \ after we believe it destroyed. Many a secret\nhas been betrayed by careless disposal. The wise guardian\
    \ ensures that\nwhen data must die, it dies completely, leaving no trace for enemies to\nrecover.\n\

    \ be woven into the fabric of every\nwall, every ward, every magical circuit from the very beginning.\n\
    \nThe great architects of old understood DEFENSE IN DEPTH - that no single\nbarrier, however mighty,\
    \ should be trusted alone. Layer upon layer of\nprotection, each independent, each capable of standing\
    \ when others fall.\nStudy the security models that govern our realm: Bell-LaPadula guards our\nsecrets\
    \ from prying eyes, while Biba ensures the integrity of our records.\n\nYou will master the arcane\
    \ arts of cryptography - the ancient mathematics\nthat transforms readable text into indecipherable\

  title: 'DOMAIN V: IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT'
  narrator: THE GATEKEEPER
  introduction: "\nWho goes there? This ancient challenge echoes through the Citadel's gates,\nfor the\
    \ art of Identity and Access Management is the art of knowing who\nseeks entry and what they should\
